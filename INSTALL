Basic instructions for compiling:

  cd oxygen-gtk
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make -j2
  sudo make install

Notes:

1/ using cmake alone (with no argument) should usually work (that is: select the right path for installing the theme)
If one wants to customize this path, on can manually set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX flag when running CMake. 
The default is equivalent to:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pkg-config --variable=prefix gtk+-2.0` ../

2/ on 64 bits machine an extra flag is needed at the CMake stage:

  cmake -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 ../
