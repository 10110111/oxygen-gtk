1/ Directories:
---------------

rc/ contains 'default' configuration files
src/ contains all the source code.


2/ some details on files in src/
--------------------------------

oxygenrcstyle:
oxygenstylewrapper: 
are the core gtk style files. Oxygenstylewrapper wraps all gtk painting calls to oxygenstyle singleton painting class.

oxygenstyle:
does all the painting, as called by oxygenstylewrapper

oxygenstylehelper: 
contains some lower level painting classes, that depend on cairo context, and not on gtk windows/widgets any more. It is also responsible for generating the tilesets.

oxygentileset:
stores 3x3 pixmap array to handle scalable widgets, similar to what kde/plasma does (as well as oxygen-qt)
they can be cached.

oxygenrgba:
stores rgba color representation and has some conversion utility functions

oxygencolorutils:
all color handling, used to shade, mix, blend, etc. It is based on code in oxygen-qt and kde/kdelibs/kdeui kcolorutils and kcolorscheme.

oxygenqtsettings:
does all the handling of Qt/Kde options, and conversion to gtk options where needed

oxygengtkicons:
is responsible for mapping/replacing gtk icons by oxygen icons. This is largely inspired from QtCurve-gtk


utility files/classes:
oxygengeometry.h: some low-level geometry classes
oxygencairocontext: some self-freed wrapper around cairo_context_t;
oxygencairoutils: some cairo/gdk-cairo utilities 
oxygengtktypenames: some wrapper around gtk type names (strings) 
oxygengtkdetail: wrapper around the 'detail' strings passed to painting routines
oxygengkutils: some widget/window ancestry tree navigation utility functions.
